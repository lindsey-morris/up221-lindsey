## My Profile
My name is Lindsey Morris and I am a second year MURP concentrating in Design and Development. I grew up in Boise, Idaho and have lived and worked in major cities across the West Coast over the last decade. Prior to moving to Los Angeles, I lived in the Bay Area for 5 years where I worked for as a Program Manager of a national organization focused on designing everyday spaces with young children and their families in mind. Within urban planning and design, I am interested in environmental justice, housing as a right, inclusive green spaces, and restorative justice. Outside of school, I enjoy film photography, make collages, hiking, swimming, dancing and being outside with my dog. 

## Course Description
UP221: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science is meant to provide students with foundational spatial data science knowledge and tools to implement through advanced geoprocessing using GIS. Course content will be relevant to urban areas and the issues that cities face today. Success in the course will mean that students are able to describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data. 

## Project Ideas
A small group of students and myself are competing in the annual APA design competition and are interested in mirroring our project topic to this course's prject. The APA project topic is Health, History, and Home in Logan Triangle, Philadelphia. We will seek to describe, anaylze, and visualize spatial data related to the neighborhood's historic and existing public health, nature access, and housing conditions, as well as potential policy and design solutions.

## Course Objectives
In this course, I would like to learn how to use and apply technical data programming and visualization skills to make maps, charts, and tables that are aesthetically compelling and effective at inspiring urban solutions.
